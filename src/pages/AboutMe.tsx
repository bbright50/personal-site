        I am a husband and a father of 4. This site won&apos;t mention much
        about them because I like to keep my family life more private. I am very
        much the stereotypical dad, with the lawncare, grilling, and new balance
        shoes. I think it is fun to take care of our home, to build things, and
        do projects around the house. I love being active, and swimming has
        become a great interest of mine lately, and I have so much more respect
        for even mediocre swimmers.

        The only thing that has been constant in my journey has been change.
        From leaving college with only one major class and duplicate general
        credits that wouldn't transfer, because of family needs, to now making
        the jump from software sales to software development so that I can work
        in a field that I am truly passionate about, it has been a wild ride. My
        wife is a saint for sticking with me through it.

        I had an excellent career in sales that taught me so many different
        things. I have always had a natural ability to talk with others, and
        sales seemed like a great choice after suddenly needing to drop out to
        provide for our new family. My years in sales taught me about people,
        but more about myself and how to work hard, be effective, and contribute
        to top performing teams. I always perfomed above average, but in my last
        few roles I was really able to be the top performer at each company I
        was at. I did well, but because I wasn't passionate about sales, I felt
        I needed to make a change.
        <br />
        <br />I have always been interested in tech, and I love building things,
        but I never took the chance to pursue software. Growing up my family was
        always on the forefont of technology. We had a LAN in our house before
        most companies did. When I started toying with the idea of a career
        change, I started learning, on my own, the basics of HTML, CSS, and
        Javascript. Once I knew I would be making a change, I started looking
        for coding bootcamps that could help me not just learn the code, but how
        to use it in a career role. I was fortunate to land an internship and
        let me continue to learn and not only expand my knowledge, but get a
        good amount of practice in a startup setting. Now that I have received a
        more formal training in a handful of coding languages and frameworks, I
        am ready to move on from my current position as an intern to a Junior
        Developer role. Here's to a(nother) brand-new journey!
