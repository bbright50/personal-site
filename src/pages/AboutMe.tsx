                I am love being a husband and father more than anything! My family is at
                the core of who I am, and they are more than I deserve, but that
                isn&apos;t quite why you are here. I have had a great career in sales,
                but I have always wanted to do something much more technical. I figured
                that this point in time in my life is better than any to make the jump.
                Since March of 2024 I have been finishing a more formal training in
                coding and looking to be able to contribute to Successr.ai, and aide in
                the development of their company. I have always been a team player that
                has played a key role in why the teams I am on finish at the top of the
                company, and I am eager to learn how I can do so in a dev role!
